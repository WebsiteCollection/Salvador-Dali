					<h1>Surrealism</h1>

					<h5 class="quotes"> &ldquo;Surrealism is destructive, but it destroys only what it considers to be shackles limiting vision.&rdquo;</h5>
					
					<p>Surrealism is an art movement during WWI and WWII that grew principally out of the Dada movement. It became popular due to the <strong class="italicized">The Surrealist Manifesto</strong> published by André Breton in 1924. He defnied Surrealism as "psychic automatism in its pure state." He meant that artists bypass reason and rationlity in order to access the unconscious mind. Surrealism is reuniting the world of dream with reality.</p><br>

					<p>Surrealism is heavily influenced by Sigmud Freud, particularly his book, <strong class="italicized">The Inerepretation of Dreams (1899)</strong>. Freud legitimized the importance of dreams and the unconscious as valid revelations of human emotions and desires. This is an important concept the Surrealist writers and artists focused on.</p>
